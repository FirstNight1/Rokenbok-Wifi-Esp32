# Rokenbok Dozer - RokStar Variant

## Common Issues
None

## Disassembly
### Pre-Disassembly
No specific pre-disassembly steps are required.
It is always suggested to remove the batteries from any unit being disassembled.

### Removing the Drive Base
1. Remove 2 screws securing the grey drive base at the back of the vehicle - M3x12
2. Lift the back of the gray drive base and slide the front out of it's indents, and the top of the drive base can be accessed.

### Disassembling the Drive Base
Content coming later - drive motors and more commonly failed gearing is accessible without disassembling the drive base.

### Disassembling the Upper Shell
1. Remove the two screws on the underside of the very front of the vehicle - M3x18
2. Remove the screw in the inset around the middle of the vehicle - M3x8
3. Carefully flip the vehicle over, and gently pull upwards on the upper shell. The wiring for the RokStar receiver and LEDs will come with the upper shell.
4. This will expose the hitch pin and linkage, and dozer arm motor, gearing, and linkage.

The LEDs on the front bumper don't like to stay in place, the glue had separated from the vehicle body on both models I opened up.  Try to re-glue them before they get broken or lost.

### Disassembling the RokStar key
1. Remove one screw from the white bracket on the underside of the RokStar key - M3x8.
2. The entire RokStar key can then be pressed upwards and removed.  Note if you leave the key removed, there is nothing that will hold the white bracket in place.  The black keyway is also loose and typically held in just by tape. If you remove the key, both those parts can either be removed, glued, taped, etc.  If you cut the wires or remove the factory tape, also re-tape, glue, etc. the black keyway piece to avoid it failling inwards.

### The blade and hitch assembly
The blade motor pinion turns a reduction gear, which turns a worm reduction gear. The worm gear drives a green clutched reduction gear, which is on a bearing and spring loaded shaft.  The green reduction gear turns a yellow segment gear, which rides freely on the dozer blade shaft.  The dozer blade shaft has a press-fit linkage with an arm that gets pushed on by the back edge of the yellow segment gear, so as that gear turns, it forces the dozer blade to raise.  There is no stop or spring on the upside of the dozer blade, so it can freely go higher or be lifted without affecting the gearing (used to ride "over" Roks without causing damage).  Also on the dozer blade linkage is another arm which pushes on a spring-loaded sliding bar which is connected to the vehicle hitch.  That bar pushes on a pivoting fork, which sits below a protrusion on the hitch pin, and raises the hitch pin when the fork is pushed and pivots.  There is no spring or similar for the hitch pin, so it can slide freely upwards from it's current position.

### Reassembly notes
There's no special wire routing or anything on this vehicle, so reassembly is a straightforward reversal of disassembly.  The only things to check is that the hitch pin hasn't fallen out, and is riding on top of the lifting fork, and that the lifting fork is in it's pivot point.

## Conversions
### General
There isn't a ton of extra space on this vehicle.  Your best bet if you need more room is the top and front of the cab, which sits above the blade motor.  Avoid wiring that could get in the blade motor gearing.
### Power conversion
No special notes for this vehicle

### Control conversion
The RokStar wires are not needed, if you want to keep the "key" in the slot for aesthetic purposes, you can coil up the excess wire, or cut it.  The likeliest items to be useful for something in the future on the RokStar key are the button and the speaker, so keep the green pair, and brown/gray pair if desired.  NOTE there are no current plans to utilize either of these, so it's totally fine to just cut them.

## Electronics
### Motors
The Dozer contains 3 motors. They are:
* 2 drive
* 1 to lift the blade and raise the hitch

### Wiring
#### Top of Circuit Board:
1. Yellow/White - front LEDs right and left (2x)
    - Yellow is positive
2. Yellow/White/Gray - blade motor
